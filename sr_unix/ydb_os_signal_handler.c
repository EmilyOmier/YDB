/* This is the signal handler function that is invoked by the Operating System currently for the following signals.
 *
 * Set up in gt_timers.c
 *	SIGALRM	-> Invokes "timer_handler()"
 *
 * Set up in sig_init.c
 *	SIGINT	-> Invokes "generic_signal_handler()"
 *	SIGSEGV	-> Invokes "generic_signal_handler()"
 *	SIGABRT	-> Invokes "generic_signal_handler()"
 *	SIGBUS	-> Invokes "generic_signal_handler()"
 *	SIGFPE	-> Invokes "generic_signal_handler()"
 *	SIGIOT	-> Invokes "generic_signal_handler()"
 *	SIGILL	-> Invokes "generic_signal_handler()"
 *	SIGQUIT	-> Invokes "generic_signal_handler()"
 *	SIGTERM	-> Invokes "generic_signal_handler()"
 *	SIGTRAP	-> Invokes "generic_signal_handler()"
 *
 * The reason to have this function is to know inside "timer_handler()" and "generic_signal_handler()" whether
 * they are invoked from within an OS signal handler or not. If invoked from within an OS signal handler they
 * cannot do operations that are not async-signal safe (e.g. malloc/free etc.). This OS signal handler function
 * will pass a "boolean_t" typed parameter to those functions that indicates whether they are being invoked
 * from inside an OS signal handler or not.
 *
 * Note that this function is not invoked as the OS signal handler only for a small subset of the total list of signals.
 * This is because only "timer_handler()" and "generic_signal_handler()" are the 2 signal handler functions in YottaDB
 * that can invoke various async-signal-unsafe functions and hence need to take care. All other signal handler functions
 * (e.g. "suspsigs_handler()", "job_term_handler()", "jobinterrupt_event()", "jobexam_signal_handler()" etc.) are simplistic
 * and do not use such functions so don't yet need this extra OS signal handler step. If/when that changes, they would also
 * need to be moved into this framework.
