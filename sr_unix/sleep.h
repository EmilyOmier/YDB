/* Note: GT.M code *MUST NOT* use the sleep function because it causes problems with GT.M's timers on some platforms. Specifically,
 * the sleep function results in SIGARLM handler being silently deleted on Solaris systems (through Solaris 9 at least). This leads
 * to lost timer pops and has the potential for system hangs. The proper long sleep mechanism is hiber_start which can be accessed
 * through the LONG_SLEEP macro defined in mdef.h.
 *
 * On Linux boxes be sure to define USER_HZ macro (in gt_timers.c) appropriately to mitigate the timer clustering imposed by
 * the OS. Historically, the USER_HZ value has defaulted to 100 (same as HZ), thus resulting in at most 10ms accuracy when
 * delivering timed events.
